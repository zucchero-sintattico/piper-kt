# CI / CD

The Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) processes are essential parts of a DevOps software development lifecycle.

During the CI process, the code is automatically built, tested, and analyzed every time a developer pushes code to the repository. This process helps to catch bugs early in the development cycle and ensures that the codebase is always in a deployable state.

The project uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to realize a CI/CD process. GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that allows automating the software development workflow directly in the GitHub repository.

## CI / CD Action

The file `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` contains the configuration for the entire CI/CD process.
This action performs build, test, release, delivery and deployment tasks.

Here a conceptual overview of the CI/CD process (arrow means depends on):

    Build
    Test1 --> Build
    Test2 --> Build
    TestN --> Build
    Release --> Test1
    Release --> Test2
    Release --> TestN
    Pages[Pages Deploy] --> Release
    Image1[Image1 Deliver] --> Release
    Image2[Image2 Deliver] --> Release
    ImageN[ImageN Deliver] --> Release
```

### Build

The build job compiles the source code and run all checks.
This part allows to stop the process instead of spawning multiple matrix jobs for testing.

### Intensive Tests

The tests job runs all the tests already run before, but with a different configuration.
It uses a matrix strategy to run the tests in parallel.

> **Note**: Given the fact project uses testcontainers they could not be run on MacOS or Windows runners.

### Release

The release job is the one responsible for determining if the code should be released.
Using semantic release task, it will compute the next version (if needed), create a new tag, and push it to the repository.
It also pushes coverage reports to codecov.io.

It will run only if the branch is `main`.
If the semantic release task determines that a new version should not be released, the CI process will stop here.

### Pages Deploy

The pages deploy job is responsible for deploying docs, Kotlin docs, OpenApi documentation, etc. to GitHub Pages.

The site is available here: [GitHub Pages](https://zucchero-sintattico.github.io/piper-kt/)

### Image Deliver

The image deliver job is responsible for building and pushing the Docker images to the Dockerhub.

This job is executed with a matrix strategy to build and push multiple images in parallel.

Images are built using [QEMU](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action) in order to target multiple architectures (linux/amd64, linux/arm64).

Here the container registry: [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/zuccherosintattico)

## Renovate

Renovate is a tool that helps to keep dependencies up-to-date.

The project uses Renovate to automatically create pull requests to update dependencies.
If possible, it will also automatically merge the pull request.

The configuration for Renovate extend from [DanySK/renovate-config](https://github.com/DanySK/renovate-config).
