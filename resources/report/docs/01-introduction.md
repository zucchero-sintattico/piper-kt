## Scenario

The project consists of creating a platform that enables real-time communication between users in various form, inspired by Discord.
Piper-kt will offer the possibility of registration and access through a login system, allowing users to establish and manage social connections through friend requests. The platform will facilitate intra-user communication, with notifications for messages and management of friendships. Users will have the freedom to create and manage their own servers, with features for managing text and multimedia channels. It will be possible to send messages, participate in voice and video calls, and manage webcams and microphones within channels. In addition, server creators will be able to moderate them, removing unwanted members.
