# Non Functional Property

Non Functional Property (or Quality attributes) of a software system are constraint on the manner in which the system implements and delivers its functionality.

In our case, we have identified the following non-functional properties:

## Operational:

1. **Availability**
    1. Fault tolerance to ensure system availability.
    2. Automatic recovery of the system in case of failure.
    3. Possibility of redundancy of critical components to ensure system availability.
2. **Scalability & Performance**:
    1. Ability of **horizontal scalability** to handle increasing operational load.
3. **Reliability & Continuity**:
    1. Restore the parts of the system that were affected by a failure.
4. **Observability**:
    1. Monitoring of system performance.
    2. Graphical representation of system performance.

## Structural:

1. **Extensibility**:
    1. Clearly defined architecture to allow the addition of new features.
2. **Maintainability**:
    1. Artifact modularity.
    2. Well-structured and understandable source code.
3. **Testability**:
    1. Automated testing.
    2. Unit testing.
    3. Integration testing.
    4. Acceptance testing.

## Security:

1. Authentication of users to verify their identity.
2. Authorization of users to access resources according to established rules.
3. Encryption to ensure confidentiality of user passwords.
